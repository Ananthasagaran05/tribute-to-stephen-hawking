        <p >Stephen Hawking (1942-2018) was a renowned theoretical physicist,
            cosmologist, and author. He is best known for his work on black holes,
            quantum mechanics, and the origin of the universe.
            Despite being diagnosed with a rare form of motor neuron disease at the age of 21,
            he continued to make groundbreaking contributions to the field of theoretical physics,
            including the discovery that black holes emit radiation, which is now known as Hawking radiation.
            Hawking was also known for his popular science books, including "A Brief History of Time,
            " which became a bestseller and brought his ideas to a wider audience. His work has had a profound impact on
            our understanding of the universe and his legacy continues to inspire scientists and non-scientistsÂ alike.

            <br>
        <p>    Hawking was born in Oxford, England, and studied at University College, Oxford and Trinity College,
            Cambridge, where he earned his Ph.D. in theoretical physics. He held several prestigious academic positions
            throughout his career, including the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, a
            post once held by Sir Isaac Newton. In addition to his scientific contributions, Hawking was also an
            advocate for disability rights and spoke out about the need for increased access and support for people with
            disabilities. He received numerous awards and honors for his work, including the Presidential Medal of
            Freedom, and was widely regarded as one of the most brilliant minds of his generation.
