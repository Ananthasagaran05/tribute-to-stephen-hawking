        <p>Stephen Hawking (1942-2018) was a renowned theoretical physicist,
             cosmologist, and author. He is best known for his work on black holes, 
             quantum mechanics, and the origin of the universe.
              Despite being diagnosed with a rare form of motor neuron disease at the age of 21, 
              he continued to make groundbreaking contributions to the field of theoretical physics, 
              including the discovery that black holes emit radiation, which is now known as Hawking radiation. 
              Hawking was also known for his popular science books, including "A Brief History of Time,
              " which became a bestseller and brought his ideas to a wider audience. His work has had a profound impact on our understanding of the universe and his legacy continues to inspire scientists and non-scientistsÂ alike.</p>
